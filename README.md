## ⚙️ Architecture / Working Flow

- **File Upload**: Supports `.pdf` and `.txt` using `pdfplumber` and UTF-8 decoding.
- **Text Summarization**: Uses `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model from HuggingFace via `transformers` to generate concise summaries.
- **Question Answering**: Uses `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad` to answer user questions based on the uploaded content.
- **Challenge Me Mode**: Randomly generates 3 questions from the document to test the user's understanding.
- **Download Responses**: All challenge answers can be saved as a `.txt` file.
